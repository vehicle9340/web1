    <p>CSS is thelanguage for describing the presentation ofWeb pages, including colors, layout, andfonts. It allows one to adapt the presentationto different types of devices, such aslarge screens, small screens, orprinters. CSS is independent of HTML andcan be used with any XML-based markuplanguage. The separation of HTML from CSSmakes it easier to maintain sites, sharestyle sheets across pages, and tailor pagesto different environments. This is referredto as the separation of structure (or:content) from presentation.</p>
